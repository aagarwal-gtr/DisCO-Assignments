Brief:

Given a graph G in the form of Adjacency matrix representation. The graph has to be read from a file in the
following format â€“
Sample input file:
0,1,1,0,0
1,0,0,1,1
1,0,0,0,0
0,1,0,0,0
0,1,0,0,0
Write a Program that checks whether the given graph is a height balanced tree or not. You can assume ith
vertex to be the root of the tree. Value of i has to be taken by the program using a scanf() statement. The
output has to be displayed over the terminal. You can assume that the number of vertices in the whole
graph to be less than 10.


1. If graph is not tree output will be directly "Graph IS NOT A TREE".
2. If graph is a tree the program will ask for the value of the root 'i'.
3. The output on the terminal will be "Graph is A HEIGHT BALANCED TREE" 
   or "Graph is NOT A HEIGHT BALANCED TREE" for the input root node value.

There are four test input files attached which are as follows:

input1.txt
This contains the adjacency matrix for a graph with 5 vertices which is a tree and is
height balanced when root is any of the nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

input2.txt
This contains the adjacency matrix for a graph with 5 vertices which is a tree and is
height balanced when root is any of the nodes 2, 4, 5.

input3.txt
This contains the adjacency matrix for a graph with 6 vertices which is a tree and is
height balanced when root is any of the nodes 1, 2, 4, 6.

input4.txt
This contains the adjacency matrix for a graph which is not a tree.

TODO 1. Review height balanced definiton
